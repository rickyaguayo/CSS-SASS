CSS GRID:
- module that brings a 2D grid system to CSS
- replaces float layouts, using less and more readable and logical CSS and HTML
- works perfectly with flexbox, which is best to handle 1D components/layouts
- completely changes the way we envision and build 2D layouts
- Like flexbox, to create a grid element, you set diplay: grid and all the direct children are grid items
- there is a column axis (y) and a row axis (x). unlike flexbox, this cannot be changed and will always be like this
- there can be multiple grid items in the same cell if both are defined to be in the same cell

- Terminology:
  - grid lines: separate the columns and the rows and are numbered (starting at 1)
  - gutter (gap): space between the rows and columns
  - grid track (row or column): one complete row/column
  - grid area: mixture of both columns and rows
  - grid cell: one grid item

- Attributes:
  - grid-template-rows: allows you to define grid rows
  - grid-template-columns: allows you to define grid columns
    - inside these, you can use repeat() to quickly define the amount of columns or rows
      - Ex: grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 100px); (2 rows that are 100px each)
    - additional columns/rows can be added at different widths by listing more after the repeat
      - Ex: grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 150px) 300px; (2 columns at 150px and 1 at 300px)
  - fr: fractional unit. like flex: 1; it can occupy the remainder of space within rows/columns
    - Ex: grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 100px) 1fr; 
    - this will create 2 rows at 100px and one row that will take up whatever remaining space available in the parent container
  - gap: allows you to define the width of the gaps
    - shorthand for row-gap and column-gap
    - if one value is given, both gaps will be the same
    - if 2 values are given, row first then column
    Ex: gap: 20px; or gap: 20px 10px;

  - grid-row-start: row line in which you want the element to start at
    - Ex: grid-row-start: 2;
  - grid-row-end: row line in which you want the element to finish at
    - Ex: grid-row-end: 3;
  - grid-row: shorthand for grid-row-start and grid-row-end
    - Ex: grid-row: 2 / 3; (same as above)

  - grid-column-start: column line in which you want the element to start at
    - Ex: grid-column-start: 2;
  - grid-column-end: column line in which you want the element to finish at
    - Ex: grid-column-end: 3;
  - grid-column: shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end
    - Ex: grid-column: 2 / 3; (same as above)
  - grid-area: shorthand for grid-row and grid-column
    - syntax is grid-area: grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end
    - Ex: grid-area: 2 / 2 / 3 / 3; (same as above)
    - kinda confusing syntax

  - using span inside grid-row or grid-column allows you to define how many rows/columns the item spans
    - Ex: grid-row: 1 / span 2; (same as grid-row: 1 / 3)
  - using -1 spans to the end of the column/row without knowing how many columns/rows there are
    - Ex: grid-column: 1 / -1; (starts in the first column and spans to the end)
