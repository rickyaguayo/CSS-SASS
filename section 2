Three pillars of good HTML and CSS: 
  1. Responsive design
    - fluid layouts
    - media queries
    - responsice images
    - correct units
    - desktop first vs mobile first

  2. Maintainable and scalable code
    - clean
    - easy to understand
    - growth
    - reusable
    - how to orbanize files
    - how to name classes
    - how to structure HTML

  3. Web performance
    - less HTTP requests
    - less code
    - compress code
    - use a CSS preprocessor
    - less images
    - compress images

CSS process when loading up a page:
  HTML:
  - loads HTML
  - parses HTML
  - HTML is loaded and creates DOM
  CSS:
  - CSS is loaded while HTML is being parsed
  - CSS is parsed 
    - resolves conflicting CSS declarations (cascade)
    - process final CSS values (percentages, rems, etc)
  - CSS is loaded and creates CSS object model (CSSOM)

  - with HTML and CSS loaded, the render tree is created
  - website rendering: visual formatting model
  - final rendered website

CSS Parsing:
1. Importance:
  - User !important declarations
  - Author !important declarations
  - Author declarations
  - User declarations
  - Default browser declarations
- If imporatance is the same, go to specificity

2. Specificity:
  - Inline styles
  - IDs
  - Classes, psuedo classes, attributes
  - Elements, psuedo elements
- If specificity is the same, go to source order

3. Source order (cascade)
  - the last declaration in the code will override all other declarations and will be applied

Unit conversion from relative to absolute (px):
- % (fonts): declared value * parents computed font size
- % (lengths): declared value * parents computed width
- em (fonts): declared value * parents computed font size
- em (lenghts): declared value * current element computed font size
- rem: declared value * root computed font size
- vh: declared value * 1% of viewport height
- vw: declared value * 1% of viewport width
