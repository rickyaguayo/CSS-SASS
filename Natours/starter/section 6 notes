- media queries dont add any importance or specificity so order matters
  - when doing desktop first, put the bigger breakpoints first so that they will be shown when going to lower breakpoints.
  - opposite for mobile first

Desktop First:
- when writing desktop first media queries, use max-width

Mobile First:
- when writing mobile first media queries, use min-width
  - we want to stay away from small screen size styles which is why we use min-width. all they styles are used to accomodate bigger screens
- Pros:
  - 100% optimized for mobile experience
  - Reduces websites and apps to absolute essentials
  - Results in smaller, faster and more efficient products
  - Prioritizes content over aesthetic design 
- Cons: 
  - desktop version might feel overly empty and simplistic
  - More difficult and counterintuitive
  - less creative freedom making it more difficult to create distinctive products
  - Clients are used to seeing a desktop version of the site as a prototype
  - Do your users even use the mobile internet? whats the purpose of your website

Selecting Breakpoints:
- Bad way: choosing breakpoints for screen sizes for popular devices
  - bad because there are other people who use not popular devices
  - this is not future proof as the popular devices go out of style quickly

- Good way: look at all the most used device widths and group them in a logical way and choose breakpoints from that

- Perfect way: ignore device widths and choose breakpoints based on where your design breaks
  - most difficult way

@content: a way of passing a block of code (styles) into a mixin
  - like the children keyword in React
  Ex: 
  @mixin respond-phone {
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      @content;
    }
  }

  @include respond-phone {
    font-size: 50%
  }

@if/@else: works same as JS if/else statements

- em/rem in media queries arent based off the root font size. they are based off the browser default (16px)
  - em is best for media queries because rems dont work well within them
  - divide 16 by the breakpoint and use that inside the media query
  Ex: 
  @mixin respond($breakpoint) {
    @if $breakpoint == phone {
      @media (max-width: 37.5em) {
        @content;
      }
    }
  }
  - the max-width is 600px(intended breakpoint) divided by 16px(default browser font size)

Order for making media queries:
  1. base + typography
  2. general layout + grid
  3. page layout
  4. components

RESPONSIVE IMAGES
- Resolution switching: serving up the same image but the resolution size depends on the screen size
  - switches between images with srcset and intrinsic file size and sizes attribute
  - sizes attribute has the media condition and how much space the image will take up on the webpage. (percentages does not work here)
  - size without condition is the default if none of the conditions are true
  - Ex: <img srcset="img/nat-1.jpg 300w, img/nat-1-large.jpg 1000w," 
             sizes="(max-width: 900px) 20vw, (max-width: 600px) 30vw, 300px" 
             alt="Photo 1">

- Density switching: serving up the same image but with different resolution depending on the screen pixel density 
  - Pixel Density: amount of pixels found in an inch or centimeter
  - density switching is used by using the srcset attribute and listing different images with x-descriptors to describe the resolution
  - Ex: <source srcset="img/logo-green-small-1x.png 1x, img/logo-green-small-2x.png 2x" media="(max-width: 37.5em)">

- Art Direction: using a different image for smaller screen that keeps the main details. Ex: on a bigger screen the main details are centered but on a phone the main details may be on the side to fit text
- make sure there is a default image src in case the browser cannot process the srcset

Graceful degradation: if newer css features are being used that dont work in older browsers/versions then a good adaptation for these older browsers/versions are good practice

Build process: (see package.json for npm scripts for each step)
  - Compilation: main.css -> style.comp.css 
  - Concatenation: style.comp.css -> style.concat.css (adds icon-font.css)
  - Prefixing: style.concat.css (adds icon-font.css) -> style.prefix.css 
  - Compressing: style.prefix.css -> style.css 

::selection allows you to style when selecting text with your mouse
- adding only screen to media queries is best practice. means that the styles will only apply on screens (not print, etc)
- when coding for touch devices, its important to add (hover: none) or (hover: hover) so that the browser can tell when you are using a touch screen or not. That way the styles used for tablets/phone can be applied outside the device width
