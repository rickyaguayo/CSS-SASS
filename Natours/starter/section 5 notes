Basic responsive design principles:

1. Fluid Layouts
  - to allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width/height
  - use %, vh, or vw instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport
  - use max-width instead of width
  - 3 types of layouts:
    1. Float layouts: old way of building layouts of all sizes using the float CSS property. Pretty outdated
    2. Flexbox: Modern way of laying out elements in a 1D row without using floats. Perfect for component layouts
    3. CSS Grid: For laying out element in a fully-fledged 2D grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components

2. Responsive Units
  - use rem instead of px for most lengths
  - to make it easy to scale the entire layout down or up automatically

3. Flexible Images
  - by default, images dont scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that
  - always use % for image dimensions together with the max-width property

4. Media Queries
  - to change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints)

calc() - powerful CSS function that allows you to to calculations in CSS
  - in regular CSS, you cannot mix units when doing calculations but you can in sass because sass is later compiled
  - if using a variable in calculations, you must wrap it in #{}
  Ex: 
  .row {
    width: calc((100% - #{gutter-horizontal}) / 2)
  }

- background-clip: determines where the elements background extends
  - with background-clip: text; paired with color: transparent; you can use an image, linear gradient, etc as the text color

- perspective: determines the distance between the z plane and the user
  - the smaller, the closer the element will appear

- to merge to background images in css, use background-image and put both images separated by a comma. 
  - background-blend-mode helps to blend the two in different ways
  - gradients are considered background images so you can use these to blend as well
  Ex:
  .bg {
    background-image: linear-gradient(
        to right bottom,
        $color-secondary-light,
        $color-secondary-dark
      ),
      url(../img/nat-5.jpg);
    background-blend-mode: screen;
  }

- box-decoration-break: specifies how an elements fragments should be rendered when broken across multiple lines, columns, and pages.
