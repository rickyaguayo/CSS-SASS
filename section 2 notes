clip-path - allows you to make different geometric shapes in css

animations: (2 ways)
1. @keyframes allows you to animate elements at different parts of the animations
  - requires name
    Ex: @keyframes moveInLeft {
    0% {
      opacity: 0;
      transform: translateX(-100px);
    }

    80% {
      transform: translateX(10px);
    }

    100% {
      opacity: 1;
      transform: translateX(0);
    }
  }
  - then you can add it to an element with animation-name:
    Ex: animation-name: moveInLeft
  - animation-duration is how long it is animated for. (in seconds)
  - animation-delay is delays the animation by the time given. (in seconds)
  - animation-iteration-count is how many times the animation happens
  - animation-timing-function is how the animation will happen over the course of the animation
  - animation-fill-mode applies css styles from the keyframes

2. transition must property on the initial state
  Ex: 
  .btn:link,
  .btn:visited {
    transition: all 0.2s;
  }

  .btn:hover {
    transform: translateY(-3px);
  }

  .btn:active {
    transform: translateY(-1px);
  }
  - any effect is always in relation to the initial state

  - if animation is a little shaky, add backface-visibility: hidden to remove the shake

-inline-block elements are treated as text so they are able to be used with text-align: center, etc

- psuedo elements:
  - must have content and display properties
  - treated as a child of the element its used on
